        Key figures of a debt instrument. The key figures are calculated using

        right to a maturity extension, an attached option, or convertibility are
        not considered for the key figure calculation. Further, a calculation is
        not performed for perpetual products and for products with variable

        The endpoint returns the possible values and value ranges for the

        the values and value ranges of the parameters of the

        search always leads to a non-empty set of notations. If more than one

        has been specified, only the notation with the highest trading volume,
