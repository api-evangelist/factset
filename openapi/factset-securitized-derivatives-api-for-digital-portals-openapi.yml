        Ranking of securitized derivatives' notations using intraday figures.
        The result is limited to 100 notations that all must satisfy all
        selected filters. If more than one notation of an instrument matches the
        parameters, and no market priority has been specified, the selection of
        the notation depends on the sort attribute:

        - absolute and relative performance (see the response attributes
        `trade.performance.absolute` and `trade.performance.relative`) - the
        notation with the most recent trade price is used

        - number trades, trading value and trading volume (see the response
        attributes `accumulated.numberTrades`, `accumulated.tradingVolume` and
        `accumulated.tradingValue`) - the notation with highest (lowest) value
        is used


        By default, the result is sorted descending by the relative intraday
        performance corresponding to the most recent trade price, see attribute
        `trade.performance.relative`. The result may contain sortable values
        based on different currencies, possibly making the ranking nonsensical,
        if the parameters `valueUnit` and/or `currency` have not been specified.


        The search can be restricted to a specific set of products by using
        customer-specific instrument or notation lists. Such restriction lists
        are set up by FactSet upon request.


        All identifiers used as parameters must be valid and entitled.

      description: >-
        The endpoint returns the possible values and value ranges for the
        parameters used in the endpoint
        `/securitizedDerivatives/notation/screener/search`. It allows to request
        the values and value ranges only for a restricted set of notations that
        match predefined parameters. If more than one notation of an instrument
        matches the parameters, and no market priority has been specified, only
        the notation with the highest trading volume, averaged over one month,
        is considered. The functionality may be used to pre-fill the values and
        value ranges of the parameters of the
        `/securitizedDerivatives/notation/screener/search` endpoint so that
        performing a search always leads to a non-empty list of notations. Lists
        of distinct values, e.g. identifiers, are sorted descending by the
        number of notations for each value.

         Since some underlyings, e.g. an index or a performance difference of a stock and an index (alpha structure), do not represent a directly tradable asset, they do not have a price in the classical sense. Therefore, the term "level" is used instead of "price", e.g. underlying level instead of underlying price.

         The endpoint does not support possible values and value ranges for securitized derivatives with multiple underlyings, thus only securitized derivatives with a single underlying are considered.

         The possible values and value ranges can be restricted to a specific set of products by using customer-specific instrument or notation lists. Such restriction lists are set up by FactSet upon request.

      summary: List of underlyings with barrier and cash flow information.
      description: >-
        Provides details regarding the underlyings, their respective barriers
        and related cash flows (if any) of a securitized derivative. A unique
        combination of a cash flow and related barrier modalities, such as
        observation and level, is called a condition. In case of a securitized
        derivative with multiple underlyings, a condition comprises the
        respective barriers of all underlyings participating in that condition.
        Since some underlyings, e.g. an index or a performance difference of a
        stock and an index (alpha structure), do not represent a directly
        tradable asset, they do not have a price in the classical sense.
        Therefore, the term "level" is used instead of "price", e.g. underlying
        level instead of underlying price.

                Underlying selection. A list of underlyings can be selected by
                either using their instrument identifiers, see parameter
                `underlying.instrument.ids` or by using their notation
                identifiers, see parameter `underlying.notation.ids` but not
                both at the same time. Only one of the provided identifiers
                needs to be matched in order for a securitized derivative to be
                returned in the result.

                 The list of underlyings is particularly useful to search for securitized derivatives that have very similar but not exactly the same underlyings such as futures with different maturities on a given commodity, e.g. brent crude oil. For such a list of underlyings, a barrier restriction in absolute terms, see for example parameter `singleBarriers.level.absolute` or `rangeBarriers.upper.level.absolute`, will provide a meaningful result, whereas for a list of non-similar underlyings, such as different stocks, a barrier restriction in absolute terms will not provide a meaningful result. This is due to the fact that futures on the same commodity are comparable in regards to their prices while two different stocks are not comparable.

                 Parameters in relative terms, see for example parameter `singleBarriers.distance.relative`, are generally comparable and will provide meaningful result for a list of similar as well as for a list of non-similar underlyings.

                 For the selection of the effective underling of factor certificates, use `factorCertificates.effectiveUnderlying.instrument.ids`.

                    Bonus yield. It represents the bonus level adjusted for the
                    cover ratio and currency cross rate minus the ask price of
                    the securitized derivative. The value can become negative
                    (e.g. for uncapped products), which does not mean that the
                    investor will necessarily suffer a loss buying it. This key
                    figure is calculated for bonus certificates with an intact
                    knock-in barrier only. To restrict the result to bonus
                    certificates with an intact knock in barrier, the parameter
                    `singleBarriers.type` must be set to `knockIn` and the
                    parameter `singleBarriers.breach.breached` must be set to
                    `false`.

                    Agio. For plain vanilla warrants, it represents the
                    difference between the ask price of the derivative and its
                    parity (see attribute `parity`). Thus, for those with
                    exercise right `call`, the agio indicates how much more
                    expensive would it be to obtain the underlying through
                    purchasing and exercising the warrant compared to directly
                    purchasing the underlying. For those with exercise right
                    `put`, the above consideration is applied inversely. For
                    other types of securitized derivatives, the calculation and
                    interpretation of the agio depends on their category.
                    Negative values are possible.

                    7/365. Weekly theta indicates the absolute change (decrease)
                    of the price of a derivative for a reduction of the residual
                    term by one week (seven calendar days), thus it represents
                    the price sensitivity of the derivative relative to changes
                    in the residual term. This key figure is calculated for
                    plain vanilla warrants only.

                Underlying selection. A list of underlyings can be selected by
                either using their instrument identifiers, see parameter
                `underlying.instrument.ids` or by using their notation
                identifiers, see parameter `underlying.notation.ids` but not
                both at the same time. Only one of the provided identifiers
                needs to be matched in order for a securitized derivative to be
                returned in the result.

                 The list of underlyings is particularly useful to search for securitized derivatives that have very similar but not exactly the same underlyings such as futures with different maturities on a given commodity, e.g. brent crude oil. For such a list of underlyings, a barrier restriction in absolute terms, see for example parameter `singleBarriers.level.absolute` or `rangeBarriers.upper.level.absolute`, will provide a meaningful result, whereas for a list of non-similar underlyings, such as different stocks, a barrier restriction in absolute terms will not provide a meaningful result. This is due to the fact that futures on the same commodity are comparable in regards to their prices while two different stocks are not comparable.

                 Parameters in relative terms, see for example parameter `singleBarriers.distance.relative`, are generally comparable and will provide meaningful result for a list of similar as well as for a list of non-similar underlyings.

                 For the selection of the effective underling of factor certificates, use `factorCertificates.effectiveUnderlying.instrument.ids`.

                    Bonus yield. It represents the bonus level adjusted for the
                    cover ratio and currency cross rate minus the ask price of
                    the securitized derivative. The value can become negative
                    (e.g. for uncapped products), which does not mean that the
                    investor will necessarily suffer a loss buying it. This key
                    figure is calculated for bonus certificates with an intact
                    knock-in barrier only. To restrict the result to bonus
                    certificates with an intact knock in barrier, the parameter
                    `singleBarriers.type` must be set to `knockIn` and the
                    parameter `singleBarriers.breach.breached` must be set to

                    Agio. For plain vanilla warrants, it represents the
                    difference between the ask price of the derivative and its
                    parity (see attribute `parity`). Thus, for those with
                    exercise right `call`, the agio indicates how much more
                    expensive would it be to obtain the underlying through
                    purchasing and exercising the warrant compared to directly
                    purchasing the underlying. For those with exercise right
                    `put`, the above consideration is applied inversely. For
                    other types of securitized derivatives, the calculation and
                    interpretation of the agio depends on their category.

                    Weekly theta. It represents the first partial derivative of
                    the function determining the derivative notation's
                    theoretical price with respect to the residual term,
                    evaluated at the current residual term and multiplied by
                    7/365. Weekly theta indicates the absolute change (decrease)
                    of the price of a derivative for a reduction of the residual
                    term by one week (seven calendar days), thus it represents
                    the price sensitivity of the derivative relative to changes
                    in the residual term. This key figure is calculated for
                    plain vanilla warrants only.

                            how much more expensive would it be to obtain the
                            underlying through purchasing and exercising the
                            warrant compared to directly purchasing the
                            underlying. For those with exercise right `put`, the
                            above consideration is applied inversely. For other
                            types of securitized derivatives, the calculation
                            and interpretation of the agio depends on their
